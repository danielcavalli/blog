## Why CSS Animations?

CSS animations offer several advantages over JavaScript-based animations. They're hardware-accelerated, more performant, and maintain smooth 60fps frame rates even on lower-end devices.

## The Building Blocks

CSS provides three main ways to create animations:

- **Transitions** - Smooth changes between states
- **Keyframe Animations** - Complex, multi-step animations
- **Transform Properties** - Efficient position and scale changes

## Performance Matters

Not all CSS properties are created equal when it comes to animation performance. Properties like `transform` and `opacity` are hardware-accelerated and won't trigger repaints or reflows.

## Practical Examples

The hover effects on this blog's cards use a combination of transforms, box-shadow, and color transitions. Each animation is carefully tuned with cubic-bezier easing functions for a natural feel.

## Accessibility First

Always respect user preferences with the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. Some users find animations distracting or disorienting, and it's our responsibility to accommodate them.
