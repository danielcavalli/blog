## Why CSS Animations?

CSS animations offer several advantages over JavaScript-based animations. They're hardware-accelerated, more performant, and maintain smooth 60fps frame rates even on lower-end devices. But more importantly, they enable a **declarative approach to motion** — you define what should happen, and the browser handles how.

This blog is built entirely on CSS-first animations. JavaScript is used only to trigger state changes; the visual behavior lives in stylesheets.

## The Philosophy of Motion

Before choosing animation techniques, consider what the motion *means*. Every transition should answer one question: **Where did this come from, or where is it going?**

On this site, animations serve three purposes:
1. **Spatial continuity** — showing that elements exist in the same shared canvas
2. **State acknowledgment** — confirming that the interface recognized an action
3. **Organic response** — making the page feel alive without being distracting

Motion is never decoration. It's the interface breathing.

## The Building Blocks

CSS provides three main ways to create animations:

### Transitions
Smooth interpolations between states. Used for hover effects, theme changes, and dropdown expansions. The key is choosing the right easing curve — `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` creates a natural acceleration and deceleration that feels like physical momentum.

```css
.custom-select {
    transition: all 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

### Keyframe Animations
Multi-step choreography for complex motions. This blog uses keyframes sparingly — only for initial page load animations where elements fade in and rise upward.

```css
@keyframes fadeInUp {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(20px);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}
```

### Transform Properties
The performance backbone. `translateY`, `scale`, and `rotate` are hardware-accelerated and won't trigger expensive reflows. When the header slides behind the navigation bar, it uses `translateY(-120%)` — pure GPU work.

## View Transitions API

Modern browsers support the **View Transitions API**, which enables seamless morphing between page navigations. This blog uses it to transform post cards into full articles:

```css
::view-transition-old(post-card-1),
::view-transition-new(post-card-1) {
    animation-duration: 0.6s;
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

The critical insight: **fetch content BEFORE calling `startViewTransition()`**. This ensures the browser captures the old state and new state synchronously, preventing flash-of-content issues.

## Performance Matters

Not all CSS properties are created equal when it comes to animation performance. 

**Hardware-accelerated (GPU):**
- `transform` (translate, scale, rotate)
- `opacity`
- `filter` (with caution — can be expensive)

**Avoid animating:**
- `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding` — triggers layout
- `color`, `background-color` alone — triggers paint
- `box-shadow` — expensive, but acceptable for subtle hover states

> "The secret to great animation is knowing what NOT to animate."

This is why the dropdown options list uses `max-height` and `opacity` instead of animating height directly — it's a compromise between performance and natural unfolding motion.

## The Rhythm of Interaction

All animations on this site follow a consistent temporal rhythm:
- **0.4–0.6 seconds** for most transitions
- **0.75 seconds** for spatial scroll effects (header sliding behind nav)
- **Same easing curve everywhere** — `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`

This consistency creates a unified "breathing" feeling. When the filters panel expands, the dropdown opens, and the cards drift away — they all move to the same tempo.

## Staggered Reveals

When showing multiple elements, stagger their appearance with CSS transition delays:

```css
.filter-row {
    transition: all 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0.1s;
}

.filter-tags {
    transition: all 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0.2s;
}
```

The filter controls appear 100ms before the tag pills, creating a cascade that guides the eye downward naturally.

## Organic Boundaries

One unique pattern this blog uses: **overflow nudging**. When a dropdown list reaches the boundary between sections, it doesn't just clip — the entire filter block expands from its bottom edge, as if making room:

```css
.filters.expanded.dropdown-active {
    padding-bottom: 5rem;
}
```

JavaScript detects the overflow and applies the class. CSS handles the motion. The result feels like the page is aware of its own geometry and responds organically.

## Theme Transitions

Switching between light and dark mode isn't just a color swap — it's an **atmospheric shift**. All color properties transition simultaneously:

```css
body.theme-transitioning * {
    transition: background-color 0.6s ease,
                color 0.6s ease,
                border-color 0.6s ease !important;
}
```

The effect: the entire page ripples through a new lighting state, maintaining the illusion of a single continuous surface.

## Practical Examples

Every interaction on this blog demonstrates these principles:

- **Card hover** — `translateY(-4px)` lift with shadow bloom
- **Tag pills** — Gradient backgrounds with 3px lift and expanding shadows
- **Dropdown unfold** — `max-height: 0 → 300px` with opacity fade
- **Filter expansion** — Staggered reveals with bottom-edge growth
- **Post morphing** — View Transitions API for card-to-article transformation

Each animation is carefully tuned to feel inevitable, not decorative.

## Accessibility First

Always respect user preferences with the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. Some users find animations distracting or disorienting:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    }
}
```

Motion should enhance, never hinder. When a user signals they need reduced motion, honor that immediately.

## The Result

CSS animations, when approached systematically, create interfaces that feel **alive but calm**. The goal isn't to impress with flashy transitions, but to build trust through visual coherence.

Every animation on this blog serves the same philosophy: one continuous surface, breathing in response to interaction, maintaining spatial logic at all times.

The interface doesn't perform. It responds.
