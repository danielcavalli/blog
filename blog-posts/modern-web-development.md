## The Evolution of Web Development

Web development has come a long way since the early days of static HTML pages. Today's web is dynamic, interactive, and more powerful than ever before. However, with great power comes great responsibility.

## Performance Matters

One of the most critical aspects of modern web development is performance. Users expect websites to load quickly and respond instantly to their interactions. Here are some key strategies:

- Minimize JavaScript bundle sizes
- Optimize images and use modern formats like WebP
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use CSS for animations instead of JavaScript when possible
- Leverage browser caching effectively

## The Power of CSS

Modern CSS has evolved to handle complex layouts and animations that previously required JavaScript. Features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS animations allow developers to create rich, interactive experiences with better performance and accessibility.

## Progressive Enhancement

Building websites that work for everyone, regardless of their device or browser capabilities, is more important than ever. Progressive enhancement ensures that core functionality is available to all users, while enhanced features are provided to those with modern browsers.

## What This Blog Taught Me

Building this site was a really good lesson and deep dive onto how much CSS has evolved since I first used it. I set out to do a site with a deliberately minimal architecture: no framework overhead, no build-time complexity beyond a straightforward Python script that compiles Markdown to HTML. What remains is CSS that does real workâ€”View Transitions API for morphing animations, design tokens for theming, and layout primitives that respond without media query sprawl.

I don't think I would've been able to do this that quickly without LLMs. The tooling made the difference. GitHub Copilot and LLMs turned front-end work (definetly not my strength) into a structured conversation rather than a back and forth through documentation. The result is a system I understand completely because I built it incrementally, testing assumptions and observing behavior at each step but that I was able to create from the ground up in one night!
