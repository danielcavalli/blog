## Summary
Machine Learning Engineer at Nubank, helping build and scale the company’s AI platform that powers hundreds of Data Scientists across multiple business units. My work bridges infrastructure and applied ML, optimizing distributed training with multi-cluster, multiGPU strategies and designing deployment workflows through Argo and Tekton. I focus on creating reliable, reusable systems that turn complex models into production-ready services.

My interests lie in MLOps, Distributed Systems, and Machine Learning Infrastructure, especially where they intersect with fintech innovation and large-scale data products.
